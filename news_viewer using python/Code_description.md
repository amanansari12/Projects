This code fetches news articles from different categories using the NewsAPI and allows the user to choose a category of news to view. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The necessary libraries are imported: 'requests' as 'req', 'time,' and 'webbrowser'.
2. An API key is assigned to the 'api_key' variable. This key is required to access the NewsAPI.
3. 'news_types' is a list of lists containing the names of news categories and their corresponding API URLs.
4. The available news categories are printed to the console.
5. The user is prompted to enter their choice of news category.
6. The selected news category's name and URL are retrieved based on the user's input.
7. The API URL is used to fetch the news articles in JSON format, and the articles are stored in the 'news_article' variable.
8. The top news articles from the selected category are displayed, including their titles, descriptions, and options to visit the corresponding website.
9. A while loop is initiated to handle user interaction.
10. The user is prompted to enter the number of the news article they want to visit or to perform other actions.
11. If the user enters -1, the program exits. If they enter -2, the loop continues for more news. Otherwise, the corresponding news article URL is opened in a web browser using the webbrowser module.
12. The loop continues until the user decides to exit or until the article count reaches a limit of 20.

The code provides an interactive way to view news articles from different categories and enables the user to read the full articles by visiting their respective websites.
